Plots of measured DOC in incubation solutions vs absorption coefficient at 355 nm (a355), showing linear regression line and equation.  Equation slope is the inverse of the specific absorbance of colored dissolved organic carbon (CDOC) and intercept is the background level of non-colored dissolved organic carbon (NCDOC).  See table 1 of Neale et al. (2023) for listing of all slopes, intercepts and r2.
